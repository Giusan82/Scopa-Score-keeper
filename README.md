Here there is an app that I made for the second project "Court Counter App" of the course "Android for Beginners".


So I decide some of unique that was not already published on udacity forum. I was inspirated at the famous italian cards game, named "Scopa".

Here you can find more detail about this game:

I have used the french symbols, because are easier to find card with it.
