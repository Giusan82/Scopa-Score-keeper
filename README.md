Here there is an app that I made for the second project "Court Counter App" of the course "Android for Beginners".


So I decide some of unique that was not already published on udacity forum. I was inspirated at the famous italian cards game, named "Scopa".

Here you can find more detail about this game:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopa

I have used the french symbols, because are easier to find card with it.

This app is complete and works without any error. Here some screenshot:

In addition it has a lot of functions. As scrolling due to high number of functions, inputs as EditText, where you can add directly the number from the keyboard before of calculating the score of the deal. Then it have several spinner with a drop menu, where it is possible easly choose the right card that you need.
